The Snappy compression format in the Go programming language.

This is a plug-in replacement for `github.com/golang/snappy`.

It provides full replacement of the Snappy package.

See [Snappy Compatibility](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/s2#snappy-compatibility) in the S2 documentation.

"Better" compression mode is used. For buffered streams concurrent compression is used.

For more options use the [s2 package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/klauspost/compress/s2).
